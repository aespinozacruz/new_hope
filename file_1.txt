Urgency is your inner compulsion and drive to get things done in a timely, yet thoughtful, manner. 
On this team, we return all phone calls and emails the same day. We’re on the lunatic fringe. 
We’re obsessed with answering inquiries ASAP. Not just to clients and partners, but to each other! 
There’s no other way, and no other option. Urgency motivates us to ensure we communicate all news fast, 
both good and bad. We take care of things, especially our clients … NOW!
